#exception handling
'''
errors in python are of 2 types:

    syntax errors and exceptions

    errors are the prblm that occur due to some incorrect syntax which
    will further stop the execution of the program
    on the other hand exception occurs when some internal event
    occurs which changes the nrml flow of the program
    exceptions are raised when the prgm is syntactically correct but still
    code execution results in error which changes the normal flow of the
    execution
'''

#diff ways to handle exception:
'''
    1.try- include the block where the exception is raised
    2.except-catches the exception
'''
l=[1,2,3,4,5]
try:
    print('first element=',l[0])
    print('element=',l[6])
except:
    print('index out of range')

'''
a try statement can have more than one except block which is used to handle
which is used to handle specific exception
'''

#at a time only one handler will be executed
